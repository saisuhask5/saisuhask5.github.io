# AI-Powered PDF Summarizer (n8n Automation)

This project, created by **Sai Suhas Kaminedi**, is an automated workflow that:

- Reads a Gmail email with a PDF attachment  
- Extracts text from the PDF  
- Summarizes it using an OpenAI Chat Model  
- Writes the summary into a Google Docs document  

This demonstrates workflow automation, AI integration, and real-world use of n8n.
